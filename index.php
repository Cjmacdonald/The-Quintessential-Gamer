<h3><font color = "3E72F3">Red Dead Redemption 2 (Review) </font></h3>
<p>
"While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marstons story, Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde
gang as a community, as an idea, and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too,
but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal, very messy story supports a larger tale.
Some frustrating systems and a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though it does
take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but its
also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and its a world that is hard to leave when its done."

<h3><font color = "3E72F3">Fall Out 76 (Impressions) </font></h3>
<p>
"After 20 hours spent in the West-Virginian wasteland of Fallout 76 via the now-concluded B.E.T.A.
(playing on Xbox One X, if you’re curious), I’ve been left with an overarching sense of curiosity.
Mainly, I’m curious why Fallout 76 exists.
<br><br>
That’s not meant to be a criticism. With so many elements working together and against one another, I wonder why
this is the next Fallout game that we’re playing, as opposed to one that leans harder into the traditional
story-driven single-player experience or a full-fledged multiplayer survival game set in the Fallout universe.
As it stands now, Fallout 76 is neither of those things – it’s stuck in some strange Appalachian limbo between
two points"

<h3><font color = "3E72F3">Spyro Reignited Trilogy (Review) </font></h3>
<p>
"Spyro’s personality is slightly changed form the originals. He has more of a bounce in his animations, and his voice is now
 consistent. I know that’s an odd thing to say, but he was originally voiced by Carlos Alazraqui, and was replaced by
 Tom Kenny for the sequels. Toys for Bob brought in Kenny to re-record all of the lines for the first game – a nice touch
 that unifies the trilogy.
<br><br>
Given just how different the worlds look in remastered form, I found this trilogy to be more interesting and enjoyable to
return to than Crash’s. These games don’t preserve history as well, but that’s okay. Having already lived through them,
it’s fascinating to see how the worlds have been reimagined and differ from the vision I had in my head. If you’ve never
played these games before, I can’t recommend them enough. From a historical standpoint, you can clearly see the foundation
for Insomnaic’s Ratchet & Clank series in each level. As a game, Spyro is a blast to control, and collecting gems is an oddly
satisfying thing to do. You’ll watch the credits roll on each game before you know what hit you."

<h3><font color = "3E72F3">Spyro Reignited Trilogy (Review) </font></h3>
<p>
"Pokémon: Lets Go, Pikachu and Pokémon: Lets Go, Eevee are new games coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch
<br><br>
They are the latest Pokémon RPG from Nintendo. That means youll take on the role of a trainer in search of Pokémon and badges.
 Youll meet characters, some familiar like Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny and other new characters youll get to know.
<br><br>
Youll wander through tall grass, thick forests, and rocky mountains as you travel from town to town in the Kanto Region.
Youll catch Pokémon in the wild, battle trainers, and gain experience for yourself and your pocket monsters.
<br><br>
Catching a Pokémon in Lets Go is similar to the mechanics used in Pokémon GO. When you see one in the wild, you can try to
 catch it by throwing a Poké ball from your inventory using the Joy-Con controller (or a Poké Ball Plus) in a flicking sort
 of motion.
<br><br>
To be clear, this is not a Pokémon GO game. It just happens to use the same mechanics for catching Pokémon.
<br><br>
Youll also battle against other trainers and other activities that usually happen in Pokémon RPGs. I dont have all of the
 details yet, but dont worry. You wont have to step foot out of your house if you dont want to."
