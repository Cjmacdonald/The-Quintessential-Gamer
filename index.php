  When the demo goes live, we’ll use a playtime time limit and a cooldown
  (that starts when you first log in) to help as many people as possible
  play the Classic demo as much as possible, community manager
  Ythisens wrote. We’ll start with a playtime limit of a cumulative
  60 minutes and a cooldown of 90 minutes.

  He cited three examples of how the system will work: If you play for
  30 minutes and then log off for 60 minutes, youll start over with a
  fresh 60 when you return; if you play for 60 minutes, youll get
  the boot and wont be allowed back in for 30 minutes; and
  (this is where it gets complicated) if you play for 20 minutes,
  leave for 20 minutes, come back and play for 40 more minutes,
  youll get kicked out but will be able to reconnect in just ten minutes.

<h3> INFO 2 </h3>
<p>
Not counting GTA 5’s remaster, this is the first game the studio has
properly released this console generation. Unsurprisingly, in the years
since the Los Santos sensation launched, Rockstar has built up a wealth
of things to say. As such, RDR2 is a game of big themes and even bigger
ideas. The evils of creeping capitalism. Corrupt regimes. The loss of
long-held beliefs. With its contextual conversations, where its outlaw
lead can either greet or antagonise hundreds of bespoke NPCs, the game
also tries to move open-worlds forward. Here, your main interactions
often involve swapping pleasantries (or devastating, old timey disses),
while significant portions of the main story involve quiet, peaceful
character-building. Compared to the wanton carousel of slaughter so
many other sandboxes choose to ride, RDR2’s more thoughtful, less trigger
-happy approach feels like a progressive step. Although that said, you
still end up shooting hundreds of dudes. Don’t worry, most of ‘em
deserve it.
